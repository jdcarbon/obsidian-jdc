"Joey," my mom said as I plowed into the kitchen, "what do you want for breakfast?"

I just stared at her for a few seconds because I wasn't really listening (you know, the whole zombie thing was taking up all the space in my brain).

"Joey? She asked again, this time looking a little worried. "Breakfast?"

"Uh, nothing mom. I gotta get to the bus," I said as I darted for the door.

But before I could get there mom stuck out her arm and blocked me. She gave me a hug and a kiss on the cheek. And then she paused and her nose wrinkled.

**ILLO::Mom smelling Joe**

I started to panic. Could she tell what was going on? If she did she was going to take me to the doctor.

And that would be bad. I could see it in my head. "Sorry Mrs. Simms, your son Joseph," the doctor always called my by my full name, "is turning into a zombie. We need to quarantine him immediately. He will be turned over to the..."

Like I said. Bad. Very bad.

"Joey," she paused. 

I held my breath.

"You stink."

"Sorry," I said as I dashed back to the stairs, "I forgot to put on my deoderanht."

I sprinted up the stairs and into the bathroom. I grabbed a can of Shield body spray and coated my entire body with it. I then jammed the can into my backpack and sprinted down the stairs.

This time I rushed right to the door, blowing past my mom.

"Have a good day, Joey."

"It's Joe mom," I shouted over my shoulder as I rushed for the bus.
