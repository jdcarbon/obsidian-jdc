"Joey," my mom said, "come sit down for dinner."

"It's Joe mom," I said while I sat down. "What are we having."

"Spaghetti and meatballs, with broccoli on the side."

I think my face turned green. 

First, the broccoli. I never liked broccoli. I mean, what self-respecting kid does? But that night was different. Usually I would force it down, eating it as fast as possible (everyone always thinks you should eat the stuff you don't like slowly, but that just makes you taste it more). But that night was different. The thought of even seeing the broccoli made me want to vomit.

And the spaghetti. I really like spaghetti. It's not my favorite food (pizza, ice cream, french fries) but I like it. But not that night. Honestly, it was on the same level as the broccoli.

Like I said, I was turning green.

But then my mom put the food down in front of me, and I saw them. Meatballs.

There were seven (my lucky number) of them piled on the spaghetti. Each one round and brown and lumpy. They looked just like little BRAAAIIINNNNSSSS!!

I shook my head. What was that?

I had been looking at the meatballs and thinking how they looked like BRAAAIIINNNNSSSSS!

I shook my head again. That was not good. 

I forced myself to look away from the meatballs and at the spaghetti and the broccoli. I tried to make myself eat them, and I did, kind of. But after every agonizing bite my eyes drifted back to the meatballs.

Finally, I couldn't stop myself, I ate one. It was incredible. And then another and another, and then they were gone.

"Joe, are you feeling okay?" My dad asked (he always calls me Joe). "You aren't getting a sick stomach, are you?"

"Uh, no dad, just left over nerves from school, I guess." I looked at the plate, thinking I should eat more spaghetti or broccoli, but I just couldn't. "Can I be excused?"

"Sure."

I hopped up and scraped the food I didn't eat into the trash. All while trying not to think about what the meatballs looked like. And how good they tasted.
