Surprisingly, the first day of school wasn't too bad. It was a typical first day.

I didn't get any homework in any classes. I guess that's not technically true. I got a syllabus and lab safety packet for science. But I just needed to sign it and have mom and dad sign it, so it doesn't really count.

The only bad thing was that I skipped lunch. As soon as I walked into the cafeteria I could just feel everyone staring at me. So I just turned around and walked back into the hallway and into one of the bathroom. I stayed in there until lunch was over.

There was also the bus ride home where I had to sit next to Steven again (he screamed at me as soon as I got on the bus). And we had to do the handshake again, with an even louder explosion.

But, considering it was my first day at a new school, and that I was a zombie. It was an okay day.
