"AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!" I screamed.

Okay, I didn't really scream. Because if I had my mom would have literally appeared in my room. She would have been asking me what was wrong while taking my temperature while telling my dad that I had to go to the doctor "RIGHT NOW!"

And that would have been bad. Very bad.

Why would it have been bad? Well I'm glad you asked. (So, I don't know if you actually asked. But I think you did, in my head.)
