It was my night to do the dishes. Okay, it was always my night to do the dishes. Mom made dinner. Dad watched tv (sports, always sports, even golf). And Matty was too little. So I did the dishes.

I was rinsing the plates to put them in the dishwasher (I asked my mom once why I had to rinse everything off the plates so they could go in the dishwasher, she said that's just how it works, I think it's just so it's more work for me). I looked out the window, and there it was. The zombie kitty!

"Mom! I'm going to take out the trash."

"Okay. Thanks Joe!" She must have been surprised that I offered to take the trash out, since she called me Joe.

I grabbed the trash bag out of the can and sprinted out into the back yard. The kitty was still there, right on top of the fence. I had to get him.

I took one step, tripped, and fell flat on my face.

By the time I stood up the kitty was gone.
