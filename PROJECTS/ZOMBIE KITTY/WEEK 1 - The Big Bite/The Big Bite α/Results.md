I spent as much time as I could in my room before school. I figured the less time I spent around Mom, Dad, and Matty, the less likely they were to figure out what was going on.

So it was literally as late as possible when I ran downstairs and into the kitchen.

"Joey, eat breakfast!" My mom said as I tried to rush by her.

"It's Joe mom," one day she would just start calling me Joe, "I can't. I'll be late for the bus."

"At least grab an apple."

I looked over at the bowl of fruit on the counter. I'm not the biggest fruit fan (if I want something sweet I'd rather have candy) but I'll still eat. But right then, even the thought of touching it made me sick to my stomach. 

I decided to grab one anyway (I didn't want mom asking any questions about how I was feeling). Then I would just throw it away at school (or give it to Steven, even though I was hoping to avoid him on the bus).

I grabbed the apple and then made a straight line for the door.

"Joey, wait."

I stopped and turned around. Slowly.

She squinted, "You look less pale today."

"Uh, yeah. I slept better last night." I smiled. The makeup worked!
