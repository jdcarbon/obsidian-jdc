I looked down the aisle of the bus. I almost missed it (it was literally closing the doors when I got there), so I was the last kid on. And it looked like all the seats were full. Or at least all the seats where I would want to sit were full.

There was one open seat. It was next to a kid that just screamed "NERD". He had bright red hair that was parted right down the middle and almost glued to his head. He was wearing the biggest glasses I have ever seen, and they made his eyes gigantic.

But that wasn't even the worst.

He was wearing a tie! Who wears a tie to the first day of school (or any day of school)?

**ILLO::Steven**

I looked around, trying to find somewhere else to sit. But there was nothing.

I walked slowly towards the seat. I would just sit quietly and not even look at the kid. Then I'd be safe.

And then, the worst possible thing happened.

"Hi, I'm Steven!" The kid yelled.

I'm not joking. He literally yelled. Like almost at the top of his lungs.

I tried to ignore him.

"What's your name?" He was even louder this time.

I looked around the bus at all the other kids. I think they were too stunned to even laugh at him. They were all just stared.

I looked over at Steven. He was opening his mouth again.

"I'm Joe," I said quietly, hoping he would take the hint.

He did not.

"Nice to meet you!" This time I could actually feel the wind from his voice hitting me. And I had to wipe a big gob of spit off my cheek.

He opened his mouth again, but before he could, I said, "Maybe you should talk a little quieter."

"Sorry," he said. I think he was trying to whisper. But it still sounded like someone almost yelling. But it was better than nothing. 

"Do you want to learn a handshake?" At first the question started out quieter, but at the end he was almost shouting again.

I most definitely did not want to learn a handshake. But it was probably better than getting shouted at some more (or at least I thought it was at the time).

Steven showed me the steps in slow motion. When he reached the end he balled his hand up in a fist and I did the same, fearing I knew what was coming.

I was right. We fist-bumped and then Stephen made the loudest explosion sound I have ever heard as he opened his hand. 

**ILLO::Handhsake**

I just stared at him with my hand frozen in mid-air. It was (at least at the time) the most embarrassing thing that ever happened to me.

"Joe," Steven shouted.

I flinched as I dropped my hand.

"Sorry," he said, in his whisper voice. "Are you a zombie?"

If I weren't a zombie my heart would have started beating so hard it would have exploded. But even without that I was freaking out. How did he know? Was it my skin? Did I stink? How did he figure it out.

"What?!" I half-shouted, half-whispered.

He kept his voice quiet-ish, "I mean, you're wearing a Zombienado shirt, and your hands cold and your kinda pale. It was a joke..." he paused to sniffle. I think he was about to start crying.

"Got ya!" I yelled.

Steven's face turned bright red. It looked like he was either going to cry or scream at me.

He did neither.

He started to laugh. It was the loudest, most obnoxious, and nerdiest laugh I have ever heard.

It was amazing.

I started to laugh too. And I kept laughing and laughing until I cried.
