Hi, my name is Joe Sims. I decided to write this so people would know the real story of what happened at Sandstone Middle School the year I was in seventh grade.

At first I was going to call it a diary. But that sounds pretty boring.

Then I thought about calling it a journal, so it sounded scientific. But it still wasn't right.

And then I figured it out: Chronicles. That sounds scientific and epic and heroic. 

The perfect name: Zombie Kitty Chronicles.
