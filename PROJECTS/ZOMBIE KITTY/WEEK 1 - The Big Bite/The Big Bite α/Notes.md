Last night was rough. I couldn't sleep at all. Which isn't surprising, since it was my first day as a zombie. I just laid there all night, thinking about it.

At some point (around the 100th time I tried counting sheep) I decided that I needed write everything down in a notebook. Which is what you're reading right now.

First thing was a list of zombie symptoms and problems.

**ILLO::zombie problems**

1. I smell bad
2. I look kind of like a zombie
3. My heart beat is slow and soft
4. I don't like any foods that aren't meat
5. What I really want is BRRAAAIIIINNNNNSSSSSS!
6. When I start thinking about the "B" word, I can't stop

Another thing I figured out while I couldn't sleep is that I don't think I'm a zombie yet. I'm just turning in to a zombie. I figured if I was completely a zombie then I would be more like the zombies in Zombienado. Drooling, groaning, falling apart, trying to always eat the "B" word. You know, all the zombie things.

So I decided to create a zombie meter. That way I can see if I'm getting worse. For now I put it at level one.

Hopefully it doesn't get too bad to fast.
