I was pretty bored. We just moved to Phoenix, so I didn't have any friends yet. I spent most of my time playing video games. Especially Zombienado 5. Literally the best video game ever. 

Mom came down stairs and asked, "Do you want to go with us to take Mattie to the doctor?" (He's my four year old brother.)

So I was bored, but I wasn't that bored. 

"Can I stay home?"

"You can stay home, but no going outside. It's too hot."

Like I said we had just moved to Phoenix, from Omaha, Nebraska. People told us that we were crazy moving to Phoenix in the summer. And they were RIGHT! It was hot enough to cook food on the sidewalk, at night.

I also knew that the heat wasn't the real reason they didn't want me outside while they were gone. They were afraid I would get in trouble. 

True, there was the time I went out when they weren't home and got stung by a bee, and my arm swelled up. But there were hundreds (okay maybe not hundreds, but a lot) of times where I had gone out when they weren't home and nothing happened. 

"Yeah. I'm not going out there, way too hot. I'll just stay inside and play Zombienado." I said.

I think we can all see where this is going.

My dad, who had just come down the stairs carrying Mattie frowned at me. He did not like me playing video games. At all. He says they give you "Brain Rot." Whatever that is.

But before he could say anything my mom said, "It's better than him going outside while we're not home."

My dad still frowned. I was worried that he was going to make me go to the doctor with them.

I tried to figure out something I could say to get out of it, but then Mattie saved the day.

"BUUUURP!"

"Let's go!" Dad said as he rushed out the door to the car.

Mattie had thrown up at least twenty times since the night before, and it sounded like he might do it again.

**ILLO:Matty throwing up**

"Okay Joey. You know the rules. No outside. Don't answer the door." She called out over her shoulder.

"I know mom. And it's Joe, not Joey!" I yelled as she closed the door behind her.

I really did try to follow the rules. I played Zombienado until I got bored. (It really was a great game, but I'd already beaten it, three times, in instant death mode.)

I tried to watch TV, but there wasn't anything good on. And the tablet was logged out, so I couldn't watch anything on it.

So, really, I had no choice but to go outside.

I went out into the backyard and kicked the soccer ball around a bit. But that gets boring pretty fast when you're by yourself. We don't have a pool, so I couldn't swim. 

Then I heard something. Something coming from the alley behind our house. (There are alleys that run behind the backs of houses. It's where the garbage cans and trucks go.)

I walked over to the gate and listened. At first I didn't hear anything, but then I heard it again. It sounded like an animal.

Maybe it was a dog, or even cooler a coyote! 

I had to see what it was. So I unlatched the gate and then slowly opened it, trying not to scare anything away.

I stepped into the alley. I didn't see any animals. Just a bunch of weeds, trash, and junk. 

I thought about going back inside. I wasn't sure when mom and dad were going to get back and I would be grounded forever if they caught me in the alley. 

But then I heard the sound again. It was coming from behind a trash bin.

I walked slowly, trying to be as quiet as I could. I crept around the trash bin.

And there it was. A dead cat. Which was cool and gross. It must have been another animal like a rat or something that I heard. Because the cat was definitely dead. Part of it's right ear was gone and it was missing its left eye. It even looked like some of its ribs were sticking out. And it for sure wasn't breathing or moving in any way.

**ILLO::Zombie Kitty**

I looked around for something to move it with. Right by my foot was an old grill spatula. I picked it up. Maybe I could flip the cat over and see if it was rotting even more. Maybe there would even be maggots or something. Super cool!

And then it happened. Just as the spatula was about to flip it over it jumped right at me, and bit my finger.

I dropped the spatula. "OWWWWW!" I yelled and made a kick at the cat. Which missed, almost making me fall. 

I looked down at my finger. It hurt but it didn't look like it had done much damage. There was just one tiny spot of blood where one of the cat's teeth had gone through the skin. 

**ILLO::Bite on finger**

"Stupid cat!" I said as I headed back through the gate. Luckily the bite was small enough that mom and dad wouldn't even notice it. I would just wash it and put on some antibiotic ointment, so it wouldn't get infected.
