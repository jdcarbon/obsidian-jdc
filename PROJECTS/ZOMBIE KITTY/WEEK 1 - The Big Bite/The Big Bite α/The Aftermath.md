After that the weekend was mostly a blur. I think I spent most of it sleeping. My parents were worried that I was getting the same thing that Matty had. But since I never threw up, they decided I just needed to rest.

And then I woke up on the first day of school, went into the bathroom, and looked at myself in the mirror.

And then I screamed (in my head, I know, but still screaming).

Why did I scream?

I was pale. Like really pale. Like white sheet of paper pale. Like Dracula coming out of his grave to suck your blood pale. 

My skin was almost white but also kind of yellow. And there were big circles under my eyes that were a kind of purple-y-green. Honestly, if I was missing an eye and groaning I would have looked just a like a zombie from zombienado.

I reached up and put my fingers on my neck. I had learned how to check for a pulse in a CPR class last year. I'd never done it on my self, but I figured it wouldn't be that different.

At first I didn't feel anything, and I kind of started to freak out a bit. I moved my fingers around a little until I felt something.

I was pretty sure it was my pulse (what else could it have been?) but it wasn't right. It was so soft I could barely feel it. And the beats were way to far apart. There was at least five seconds between each beat. With how much I was freaking out (which was a LOT) it should have been way faster.

I pulled my hand away and looked back at the mirror. At that point I was pretty sure I knew what was going on.

1. Kitty that looked like it was dead but then bit me
2. Sick all weekend
3. Pale weird skin
4. Slow soft pulse

I was turning into a zombie.
