While I was not sleeping I came up with a plan for my looks. If I was right about becoming more of a zombie, then I needed a way to hide that.

After I finished up with the notebook it was still pretty early. My dad always says he's going to get up early for a jog. But he never actually does it. 

I snuck down the hallway as quietly as I could. I looked into Matty's room as I went by (he sleeps with the door open and the lights on, he's super afraid of the dark) and he was still asleep.

Then I checked in on mom and dad.

"Mom, dad?" I whispered into their room through the tiny crack that they always left their door open.

I counted to thirty (1 zombie, 2 zombie, might as well go with it) to see if they said anything. They didn't.

I crept downstairs and grabbed the tablet off its charger, reminding myself to put it back before mom and dad woke up (I would be in big trouble if I was on it while they were sleeping).

I made my way up to the kids bathroom, closed the door as quietly as possible, and then turned on the lights. I pushed the button on the tablet and held my breath.

It was unlocked!

They hadn't locked it since Matty had been on it the day before. I opened up the browser and headed for SlickVids. Then I searched for makeup tutorials.

That's right, makeup tutorials. I realized last night that makeup would be the perfect way to hide the fact that I was turning into a zombie. But it's not like I could ask my mom for help.

"So mom, can you teach me how to put on makeup?"

"Why?"

"Uhh...."

**ILLO::Asking mom for help with makeup**

Exactly, there are zero good ways for that conversation to end. So. makeup tutorials.

I searched through the videos, looking for one that was short and that would help people who look too pale. 

When I found one that was promising I clicked on it and then went to set the tablet down, but before I could...

"Crunchy-Os, the best..." came blaring out of the tablet.

Crud! I forgot to turn down the volume. Matty always watches his shows at full blast.

I stabbed the "mute button on the video" and then I froze, hoping that it hadn't woke up Matty or Mom or Dad.

I counted in my head again, this time to 60 zombie. 

I sighed. They hadn't woke up.

I turned down the volume to the lowest setting before I turned the video on. It was time to put on some makeup.
